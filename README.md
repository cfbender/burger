# Veggie Burger Bash

## A site to track everyone's burger eating habits!

Check out the app [on Heroku!](https://afternoon-garden-59398.herokuapp.com/)

This site was built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), but was also built with [Handlebars](https://github.com/cfbender/burger/tree/handlebars).

The handlebars branch houses the code for the version built with handlebars. I was required to build it using this framework, so here it is! I thought Svelte would be more fun, so I built it in that as well.

## Usage

Add your burger in the text box at the bottom, and then devour it with the new button provided! The right side will show all burgers eaten previously.
